## Introduction
This is the repo for Group 11 of STAT3007 @ UQ in Semester 1, 2025. Our project proposal can be found in [documentation/proposal.pdf](https://github.com/Joov95/stat3007-G11-2025/blob/main/documentation/STAT3007_7007%20G11%20Proposal.pdf).

## Usage
This repository includes three separate notebooksâ€”one for each of the models we trained. Each notebook is organized by different methods tested, clearly separated under their own headings. To explore the various methods, simply run the notebook cells in order from top to bottom.

For the two models trained on the MNIST dataset, you have two options:

Train from scratch for 5 epochs, or

Load pre-trained weights located in the weights folder (these weights were obtained after 5 epochs of training).

For the final model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, you can either:

Generate 50,000 fake images using the provided code, or

Use pre-generated images available in the images folder.

The code runs out of the box in Google Colab, without any modifications.
If you're running the notebooks locally or in a different environment, you may need to make minor path adjustments to properly load weights or images.
